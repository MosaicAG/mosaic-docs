We use cookies to improve your experience, understand platform usage, and enhance site navigation and security. You can control cookie settings through your browser.

4. Data Sharing and Disclosure&#x20;

We only share your data with third parties when necessary for service provision, legal compliance, or with your explicit consent. Our third-party service providers are bound by confidentiality agreements and do not have permission to use your personal data for their own purposes.

5. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policy&#x20;

Mosaic, as a decentralized platform, is committed to maintaining high standards of compliance with anti-money laundering regulations where feasible. Recognizing the limitations inherent in a decentralized system, we focus on indirect measures to mitigate money laundering risks.&#x20;

#### AML Measures

1. Transaction Monitoring: We deploy algorithmic tools to analyze transaction patterns across the network that may suggest suspicious activity.
2. Smart Contract Audits: All smart contracts are rigorously audited by third- party security firms to prevent vulnerabilities that could facilitate illegal activities.
3. User Education: We provide guidance to our users on the importance of using Mosaic for legitimate transactions and the legal repercussions of illicit activities.
4. Community Reporting: Users are encouraged to report suspicious activities. While Mosaic  cannot freeze transactions or access user wallets, we take such reports seriously and investigate them to the best of our ability.&#x20;

#### Limitations Acknowledgment&#x20;

Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain, our ability to directly enforce AML protocols is limited. However, we are dedicated to upholding the principles of AML compliance by discouraging and mitigating risks through the measures listed above.

6. Data Security&#x20;

Privacy and policy 2 We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data. However, no system can be entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

6. Your Rights&#x20;

You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data. Please contact us if you wish to make such a request.

6. Changes to This Policy&#x20;

We may update this policy periodically. We will notify you of significant changes and encourage you to review the policy regularly.

# Integration Partners

### **Fee Structure:**

Mosaic operates with no default protocol fees. However, integration partners have the option to charge a fee on swaps facilitated through their integration. If a platform fee is applied, Mosaic retains **15% of the platform fee** charged by the integrators by default.
